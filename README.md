# Khit

Khit is an annotation processor that helps you read table files(_Microsoft Excels, OpenOffice Calculator_). It is a wrapper over the native SDKs that each platforms offers.

# How to

To get started, simply annotate a class with `@Page`. This will tell Khit to generate and adapter for this class.

Next, annotate each member with `@Key` and give the name of the column where the value is.

``` kotlin
@Page
data class Item(
    @Key(name = "id") val id: Double,
    @Key(name = "name") val name: String?,
    @Key(name = "available") val available: Boolean,
)
```

But to parse them, you will need an adapter.

In order to get the adapter, use ` Khit.adapter(T::class.java)`. This will return a `KhitAdapter` of type `T` that can parse sheets.

Next, get a file reader using `KhitFileReader`, 
```kotlin
val reader = KhitFileReader {
    path = AbsolutFilePath("path_to_your_file")
    type = FileType.MICROSOFT
}
```
Load your file, select the `KhitSheet` you want and pass it to your adapter!

The adapter will open & read the sheet and will return you a list of `RowReadResults`, that tells you which rows were succesfully read and which were not. 

:smile: That's all!
